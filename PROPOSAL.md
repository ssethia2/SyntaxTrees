# Project Proposal

I will be making an application that generates *syntax trees* of sentences based on the [**X-Bar Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-bar_theory). 

### The Project

I will apply the **X-Bar theory** to parts of speech entered by the user to form the different phrases:

* noun phrases
* verb phrases 
* preposition phrases
* adjective phrases
* adverb phrases

Then I will build on these phrases to build more phrases and eventually envelop the whole sentence in a complementizer phrase. From this, I will display a *syntax tree* for the sentence in a new window, using openFrameworks. 

### Libraries

I will use ofxGUI to display the binary tree on the openFrameworks window. 

### Background

I am taking [**LING 301: Elements of Syntax**](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2018/spring/LING/301) this semester at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champiagn](http://illinois.edu/). I have been taught how to draw *syntax trees* using the **X-Bar Theory** in that class. I will apply this knowledge to complete this project.
