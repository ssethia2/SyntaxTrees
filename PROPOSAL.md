# Project Proposal

I will be making an application that generates syntax trees of sentences based on the [X-Bar Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-bar_theory). 

###The Project

I will be using a library[FreeLing](http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/node/1) to categorize the Parts-Of-Speech of a sentence entered by the user. Then I will apply the X-Bar theory to form the different phrases:

*noun phrases
*verb phrases 
*preposition phrases
*adjective phrases
*adverb phrases
*complementizer phrases 
*tense phrases

Then I will build on these phrases to build more phrases and envelop the whole sentence in a complementizer phrase. I will put these in [Bracketed Notation](http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Labeled_bracketing). From this, I will generate a syntax tree for the sentence in a new window, using openFrameworks.
